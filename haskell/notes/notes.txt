Mathematics:    Haskell
    f(x)        f x 
    f(x, y)     f x y
    f(g(x))     f (g x)
    f(x, g(y))  f x (g y)   f x (g (y)) -> Paranthesis group things. In this syntax f function will have only one parameter. 
                                            Haskell will ask where is the second arguement?

Basic data types 
Int: fixed-precision integer 
Integer: Arbitrary-precision integer (no limit for precision)
Float: single-precision floating-point number 
Double: double-precision floating point number (11 points precision)
Char: a single character (defined by single quotes)
Bool: Boolean value (T or F)
[Char]: String

Data initialization 
- in haskell, variables are final. even the methods do not modify variables 
- if you need to modify variable, return a new one in the function 
- for "floating values"(?) if you don't write a type, it will be by default Double 
- indentation is important: after do blocks, at least 2 spaces is needed - no tabs!!
